# DEProject_Smart_Surveillance_System_for_Home_Caring
This is the project we did for our master program. 


Abstract 
Smart devices have the possibility to assist in various tasks and thus
steadily gain importance in many aspects in everyday life.
This project elaborates the feasibility of designing a Smart Surveillance
System for Home Caring using a Raspberry Pi computer with its camera as
hardware and Neural Networks for image processing. Three main functions
have been applied on the system which are: Facial Recognition, Emotion
Detection and Pose Estimation.
